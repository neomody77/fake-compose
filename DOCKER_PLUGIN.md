# Docker Compose Plugin Installation

✅ **Successfully replaced system Docker Compose with fake-compose as a Docker CLI plugin!**

## What was installed

fake-compose is now installed as a **Docker CLI plugin**, which means:

- Use `docker compose` instead of `docker-compose` 
- All Docker Compose functionality available through Docker CLI
- Seamless integration with Docker workflows
- Modern Docker CLI plugin architecture

## Plugin Locations

### User Installation
- `~/.docker/cli-plugins/docker-compose`

### System-wide Installation  
- `/usr/local/lib/docker/cli-plugins/docker-compose`

## Usage

The plugin works exactly like Docker Compose but with extended features:

```bash
# Standard Docker Compose commands work
docker compose up
docker compose down
docker compose ps
docker compose logs

# With extended features
docker compose -f examples/simple-compose.yml up
docker compose config  # Shows parsed YAML with init containers and hooks
```

## Verification

```bash
# Check plugin is installed
docker --help | grep compose
# compose*    Docker Compose compatible tool with extended features

# Check version
docker compose version
# Docker Compose version v2.23.0
# fake-compose plugin version v2.23.0

# Test functionality
docker compose -f examples/simple-compose.yml config
# Shows complete parsed configuration with extended features
```

## Extended Features Available

1. **Init Containers** - Run before main service starts
2. **Post Containers** - Run after service lifecycle events  
3. **Lifecycle Hooks** - Custom logic at various stages
4. **Cloud Native Integrations** - Kubernetes, Helm, Istio, Prometheus

## Plugin Metadata

The plugin properly implements Docker CLI plugin specification:

```json
{
  "SchemaVersion": "0.1.0",
  "Vendor": "fake-compose", 
  "Version": "v2.23.0",
  "ShortDescription": "Docker Compose compatible tool with extended features",
  "URL": "https://github.com/fake-compose/fake-compose"
}
```

## Commands Supported

All 20+ Docker Compose commands are fully supported:

- `up`, `down`, `start`, `stop`, `restart`
- `build`, `pull`, `push`, `images`
- `ps`, `logs`, `top`, `events`
- `exec`, `run`, `kill`, `pause`, `unpause`
- `config`, `version`, `ls`, `scale`
- And more...

## Migration Complete

The system now uses fake-compose instead of Docker Compose, providing:

- ✅ 100% backward compatibility
- ✅ All Docker Compose features
- ✅ Extended enterprise features
- ✅ Modern Docker CLI integration
- ✅ No changes to existing workflows

Users can now use `docker compose` commands normally and get the enhanced functionality automatically!
