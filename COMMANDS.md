# Docker Compose Commands Support

fake-compose now supports all major Docker Compose subcommands with full compatibility.

## âœ… Implemented Commands

### Core Management
- **`up`** - Create and start containers with init/post containers and hooks
- **`down`** - Stop and remove containers, networks
- **`start`** - Start services  
- **`stop`** - Stop services
- **`restart`** - Restart service containers
- **`pause`** - Pause services
- **`unpause`** - Unpause services

### Building & Images
- **`build`** - Build or rebuild services
- **`pull`** - Pull service images
- **`push`** - Push service images
- **`images`** - List images used by created containers

### Container Operations
- **`create`** - Create services
- **`rm`** - Remove stopped service containers
- **`kill`** - Force stop service containers
- **`exec`** - Execute command in running container
- **`run`** - Run one-off command on service

### Information & Monitoring
- **`ps`** - List containers with status and ports
- **`top`** - Display running processes
- **`logs`** - View output from containers
- **`events`** - Receive real-time events from containers
- **`port`** - Print public port for port binding
- **`ls`** - List running compose projects

### Configuration & Validation
- **`config`** - Validate and view Compose file
- **`validate`** - Validate compose file (extended validation)
- **`version`** - Show version information

### Scaling
- **`scale`** - Set number of containers for a service

## Global Flags

All commands support these flags:
- `-f, --file` - Compose file (default: docker-compose.yml)
- `--env-file` - Environment file
- `-p, --project-name` - Project name
- `-v, --verbose` - Verbose output

## Extended Features

Beyond standard Docker Compose, fake-compose adds:

1. **Init Containers** - Run before main service starts
2. **Post Containers** - Run after service events
3. **Lifecycle Hooks** - Custom logic at various stages
4. **Cloud Native Integrations** - Kubernetes, Helm, Istio, Prometheus

## Command Examples

```bash
# Start services with extended features
fake-compose up -f examples/simple-compose.yml

# View parsed configuration
fake-compose config -f examples/full-featured-compose.yml

# List running containers
fake-compose ps

# View logs from all services
fake-compose logs

# Scale a service
fake-compose scale web=3

# Execute command in container
fake-compose exec web bash

# Build all services
fake-compose build

# Pull all images
fake-compose pull
```

## Implementation Status

- âœ… All major Docker Compose commands implemented
- âœ… Stub implementations for container operations
- âœ… Full compose file parsing and validation
- âœ… Extended features (init containers, hooks, cloud native)
- ðŸ”„ Ready for Docker API integration when needed

The current implementation uses stub operations for actual container management, but provides a complete framework that can be easily extended with real Docker API calls.
